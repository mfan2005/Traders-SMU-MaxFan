Level 1 (Junior) 

## 1. Background in Quantitative Finance

*In this section, describe your current background in quantitative finance. This could include:*
- *Relevant coursework or degrees*
- *Previous internships or jobs*
- *Personal projects or research*
- *Trading experience (if any)*
- *What sparked your interest in quant finance*

In high school, I was able to take Calculus AB and Statistics which made me realize that math was one of my strong suits. I have also been in the real estate finance industry for the past 2 years which opened my eyes to the world of finance. On top of that, 9 months ago, my friend introduced me to the world of trading stocks and indices. At first, I was trading options on Webull and Robinhood, but eventually moved on to trading Nasdaq futures. Since then, I have backtested over 160 hours worth of historical data as well as spent 300+ hours live trading and studying. I am really passionate about it and hope to use my skills to learn more about the realm of quantitative finance.
 
## 2. Career Goals

*In this section, outline your short and long-term career goals. Be specific about:*
- *What roles or positions interest you*
- *Which companies or types of firms you'd like to work for*
- *Specific areas of finance you want to specialize in*
- *What you hope to achieve in 1, 5, and 10 years*

I am interested in being either a high frequency trader or potentially a portfolio manager. I would prefer to work at a big name like Citadel or a boutique hedge fund. I hope to specialize in the world of trading, risk management, and executions rather than the development of models. In a year, I hope to broaden my knowledge about quantitative finance, learn more math modeling, and learn the basics and foundations of different coding languages such as C++ and Python. In 5 years, I hope to land a job at a hedge fund as a trader and in 10 years, I hope to have lots of experience as a trader and potentially go off create my own firm within finance.
## 3. What I Hope to Learn from This Program

*In this section, describe what specific knowledge, skills, or experiences you hope to gain from the Alpha Program:*
- *Technical skills (programming, math, statistics)*
- *Financial concepts and trading strategies*
- *Specific tools or platforms*
- *Networking opportunities*
- *How this program fits into your overall learning path*

I hope to learn more about coding which is my weakness and solidify my knowledge about math, statistics, and technical analysis. I also hope to learn about machine learning which really intrigues me. I want to be on the other side of things and see how big firms and institutions trade and learn how to create my own algorithms to conquer the markets. I also want to be able to be fluent in coding languages such as Python and C++ which are the essential building blocks in quant finance. I also hope to reach out to SMU alumni to see how they were able to achieve success after college and the different routes they were able to take. 
## 4. Current Technical Skills

*In this section, honestly assess your current technical skills. Rate yourself (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced) in:*
- *Programming languages (Python, R, etc.)*
- *Data analysis tools*
- *Statistical analysis*
- *Financial modeling*
- *Machine learning*
- *Version control (Git)*
- *Other relevant skills*

I am a beginner in programming, machine learning, version control, and financial modeling. I am intermediate in data analysis tools, statistical analysis, and retail technical analysis and risk management.
## 5. Development Plan & Program Goals

*In this section, outline:*
- *Specific skills you plan to develop during this program*
- *How you will measure your progress*
- *Time commitment you're planning to dedicate each week*
- *Resources you'll use beyond the program materials*
- *Your definition of success for this program*

I really hope to learn how to code using Python and C++ and learn more about algorithm development and statistical/data analysis. I also want to learn more about how big institutions use these algorithms to have an edge in the market. I will measure my progress by seeing if I will be able to code on my own and if I have gained knowledge about analysis. I’m planning to commit 7-13 hours a week depending how busy my schedule is. I will continue to be progressing with my trading and continue to expand my knowledge on options and the futures/stock market. My definition of success for this program is to help give open the door to different quant finance paths outside of college.
